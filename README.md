## Task for Upwork Dev

Hello! This is a simple CRA 2 application that does basically nothing, but plays host to a [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) project.

That Storybook project is where you'll be doing most of the work we need and it also includes full instructions for the task. This task *does need to be done*, as the primary purpose is to create a good template for future reusable components, but the primary purpose of this task is to determine whether we would like to work with you further.

There is much more detail inside the "Task Description" story of the Storybook, so just run `yarn storybook` and get started! If you cannot run the storybook for any reason, please contact me at ben@standardbots.com and I'll do my best to help.
